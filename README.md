# Rendezvous Reminder

## Description
The Rendezvous Reminder application sends email updates on recent cancellations and new openings for the highly sought-after Rendezvous Huts. Users can enter their email address to receive timely notifications when a reservation spot becomes available, making it easier to book a last-minute trip.

## Why?
The Rendezvous Huts are often fully booked far in advance, making it difficult for people to secure a reservation on short notice. This application solves the problem by alerting users when a hut reservation opens up due to cancellations or new availability, allowing users to quickly act on those openings.

## Quick Start
The application is currently available in code form and requires an IDE to run. It is built with Java, Spring, and Hibernate, and uses Selenium for web scraping. To get started:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse.
3. Run the application using Spring Boot.

## Usage
1. Enter your email address into the designated input box.
2. The application will scan for updates and send an email notification if new openings or cancellations occur in the Rendezvous Huts.

## Contributing
